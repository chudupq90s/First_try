        <h2><strong>July 12th 2014 - What I have learnt from life?</strong></h2>
        <p style="color: rgb(46, 44, 44);font-size: 21px ; font-family: sans-serif;">Life has taught me that the saddest days are also the days you have the most reasons to smile. Because things can only get better from here, the sun can only shine brighter the next day, and when you've hit rock bottom, you can only go upwards from there. Because just as cold teaches us to appreciate warmth, and loss teaches us to appreciate what we have, sadness teaches us what it means to be happy.

        <p style="color: rgb(46, 44, 44);font-size: 21px ; font-family: sans-serif;">Life has taught me that peace is not finding 'balance', having everything in its place, or even in quiet and solitude. There is a peace that's found in chaos and confusion, in heartache and despair - a peace that only you can give yourself. Because being at peace with the world around you starts with being at peace with yourself. It is a peace that says no matter what the world tries to take from me, the one thing it cannot take is who I am. And who I am is enough.</p>
        <p style="color: rgb(46, 44, 44);font-size: 21px ; font-family: sans-serif;">Life has taught me that happiness is not something that happens to you. Happiness is something you chase, and when you catch it, you do everything it takes to hold on to it. Happiness is a choice. You will find it if you seek it, but it won't come without work. Happiness doesn't come from things or accomplishments - what seems like happiness is very often just pride or security. Real happiness comes from things you can't see or put a price tag on.</p>
        <p style="color: rgb(46, 44, 44);font-size: 21px ; font-family: sans-serif;">Life has taught me that change is as much a part of it as is the fact that no matter what happens, the sun will always rise tomorrow, and as long as we're living, each new day is one more chance to get these lessons right.</p>
